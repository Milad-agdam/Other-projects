## Diabetes
The dataset includes several medical predictor variables
and an objective variable, the outcome. Predictive
variables include the patient's number of pregnancies,
BMI, insulin levels, age, etc.
Our goal today is to make meaningful inferences that will
in turn be used to identify diabetes in an individual.

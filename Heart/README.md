Heart attack is a colloquial name for a condition,Myocardial Infarction, which is characterised by reduction in blood flow to the muscles of the heart via the coronary arteries,leading to tissue injury and subsequently tissue death. Approximately 1.5 million cases of Heart attack occur in the United States,death resulting from Coronary Artery disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and Europe.

Early detection, and prompt treatment can help prevent death, alongside identifying risks early and carrying out other preventive measures such as lifestyle changes, treatment of comorbidities,and pharmacological intervention. Symptoms include chest pain, fatigue, lightheadness, syncope,shortness of breath etc.

I will be using the data set to answer the following questions

Among the population recorded, what is the frequency of coronary artery disease
what are the relationships between the variables and coronary artery disease
what factors are most important in determining incidence of coronary artery disease
Data introduction : The dataset contains 13 independent variables and one dependent variable recorded as ‘output’ ,and stands for a diagnosis of coronary artery disease.

Data cleaning: Column names were changed from abbrevaitions to aid understanding. A single duplicate data was removed, no missing values were recorded.I also ensured that there were no outliers and/ or misformatted values.
